## Common Cloud Controls CLA Onboarding

This file is used to onboard Common Cloud Controls participants onto the FINOS Standard CLA.

To get started, [just submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/finos/common-cloud-controls/edit/main/EASYCLA_CHANGEME.md) with a simple change to this file, adding an empty line, or some random text at the bottom. 

This will trigger the EasyCLA bot, which will post a comment to the Pull Request stating whether all PR contributors are covered by the FINOS CLA. 

If you are not covered, EasyCLA will post instructions on how to sign the FINOS CLA.

You can read more about EasyCLA on [FINOS community repo](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/docs/governance/Software-Projects/EasyCLA.md).
