# Governance Bootstrap

In March 2023, the CCC community identified a need for improved organizational structure to better enable contributions to the standard.

This improvement work is being done in two phases, detailed below.

Because this work includes the creation of strict charters and limitations on future change, it will only happen this way once. All subsequent changes must follow steps outlined in the respective group charters.

# Phase 1 — Steering Committee Bootstrapping

The first, and most important step, is to create a charter and assign members to the top level organizational unit: the Steering Committee. This must be done through a consensus of the most active CCC participants from financial service institutions, with an opportunity for input from the entire community.

Process:

1. A proposed charter will be presented to an open-invite irregular call
1. Inaugural committee members will be nominated by the members of the same call
1. The greater community will be notified via ccc-participants+subscribe@lists.finos.org
1. A feedback period will be held for seven (7) days, during which time anyone may give feedback
1. A consensus will be sought in an open-invite irregular call at the end of the feedback period
1. If consensus is achieved, the charter will be accepted

# Phase 2 — Organizational Bootstrapping

The second step is only marginally less critical than the first. In this phase, the Steering Committee (SC) will be asked to meet frequently to define the community structure, document the processes surrounding it, and launch the inaugural community groups. The goal is to have this proccess quickly completed so that the subsequent groups are free to begin their work.

Following the procedure set out in the SC charter:

1. The SC will determine the exact scope of work and set a meeting cadence for the bootstrapping phase.
1. The SC will define and document the intended community structure, including all group types, member roles, and accountability structure.
1. The SC will set the charters for any inaugural groups, then appoint leadership as needed.
1. The SC will operate at a heightened awareness for the next two months, seeking to iterate on the community organizational structure and/or support community groups as needed.
1. At the end of the aforementioned, the SC should scale back to allow groups to self-organize according to their respective charters.
