# Community Structure Working Group

This working group facilitates the structure and governance design for the Common Cloud Controls project community.

## Mission

The mission of the Community Structure Working Group is to establish robust, scalable, and efficient frameworks for the governance and operation of all community working groups within the CCC. 

By designing clear guidelines and structures, this group ensures consistency and facilitates effective collaboration across the entire community. It acts as a central body to guide the formation and operation of other working groups, helping them align with the overarching goals of the CCC.

## Approach

- Work closely with community members and stakeholders to gather insights and requirements.
- Maintain open and transparent communication channels for all WG activities and decisions.
- Adapt processes and guidelines as necessary to meet the evolving needs of the community.
- Ensure all decisions and guidelines are well-documented and accessible to the community.
- Strive for representation from diverse community segments when forming recommendations.

## Responsibilities

- Interface with FINOS team to implement repository controls
- Propose and maintain community policies and guidelines
- Provide advice and support to WGs

### Output / Deliverables

This group should, at minimum, create and maintain the following items in the project GitHub repository.

- Community Group Strategy, including:
  - Group Naming conventions
  - Limitations
  - Formation Processes
- Community Group Charter Policy, including:
  - Charter Format & Contents
  - Proposal Policy
- Writing Conventions / Style Guide

## Out of Scope

This working group is not responsible for approving proposed policies or ensuring compliance with policies.

To reduce unilateral authority from either this group or the SteerCo, all policy proposals should come from this group and be finalized through a vote from the SteerCo.

## Membership

The membership structure of this working group, including roles and responsibilities, must adhere to the latest recommendations from the Community Structure Working Group. 

Where recommendations do note yet exist on a topic, this working group should follow guidance from the CCC SteerCo.

## Community Cadence

A member of this working group should be present on for any calls scheduled by the SteerCo for participation by the full CCC community, such as quarterly SteerCo calls.

This working group will use the mail group <ccc-structure@lists.finos.org> for regular communications.
