# Common Cloud Controls (CCC) Community Structure

The CCC community is organized into a structure that enables contributors from diverse backgrounds to collaborate on developing the Common Cloud Controls standards. This structure ensures efficient governance, clear guidance for contributors, and effective management of the project's technical and non-technical aspects.

All community group participants must strictly adhere to the the [FINOS Code of Conduct].

## Steering Committee

The **Steering Committee (SC)** is the ultimate governance body of the CCC project, responsible for strategic oversight, financial planning, defining the project's values, high-level decision-making, and coordination with the FINOS TOC or Board. It also handles the overall project structure and delegation of responsibilities to various groups.

Review the [Steering Committee Charter] for more information.

## Governance

The CCC community adheres to a transparent and open governance model. Decisions are made through consensus or vote, depending on the group charter.

Non-technical issues or high-level design decisions may be escalated to the [SC] if a decision or conflict is not resolved in a timely (relative to the time-sensitivity of the issue).

## Changes to the Structure

Changes to the community structure can be proposed through pull requests to the governance documentation. All changes must be approved by the [SC] following a public review and voting process in accordance with the [SC] charter.
